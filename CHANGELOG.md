- **OIDC Token Validation** — JWKS fetcher with 1-hour TTL cache, JWT signature validation, iss/aud/exp claim checks; configured via `OIDC_ISSUER`, `OIDC_CLIENT_ID`, `OIDC_JWKS_URI` environment variables; ready for Okta, Auth0, Azure AD, Keycloak
- **Kubernetes/Helm Chart** — 23-file production-grade Helm chart at `infrastructure/helm/mutx/` with component templates (API, Web, OTel Collector, Redis, Postgres, Ingress, HPA, Secrets, ServiceAccount), `values.yaml` dev defaults, `values.prod.yaml` HA overlay, `values.staging.yaml` middle ground, templated OTel Collector config, auto-generated secrets, Helm test pod
- **Self-Hosted Docs Platform** — replaced GitBook with a complete `/docs` system in the Next.js app: remark→rehype Markdown rendering, sidebar navigation, breadcrumbs, prev/next navigation, full-text search with Cmd+K, right-rail TOC, GitBook hint blocks, card-grid tables, code copy buttons, light/dark theme, mobile sidebar, WCAG contrast fixes (58 commits)
- **Autonomous Dev Lane** — GitHub issue → worktree → PR reconciliation subsystem with issue-fed autonomy queue, worktree task dispatching, auto-reconciliation of safe PRs, auto-resume on usage-limit reset, fleet task prioritization, stale task recycling, guild-style run artifact schema, OSS attribution ledger, daemon runtime hardening
- **SDK Adapter Hardening** — CrewAI `run_crew()` now uses `MUTX_API_KEY` env var with `ValueError` guard (was hardcoded empty string); LangChain `stream_events()` replaced stub with real async generator using deque buffer, callback monkey-patching, and background asyncio task
- **Landing Page + Contact Page Redesign** — below-hero landing redesign with refined motion, recomposed example cards, terminal failure scenes, responsive audit; new dedicated contact page hero layout with 2-col desktop grid and mobile-first stacking

## [1.3.0] - 2026-03-27

### Added
- first-party macOS download routes under `mutx.dev/download/macos/*` with stable GitHub release asset resolution
- a public `mutx.dev/releases` surface that ties together the current desktop release, GitHub assets, checksums, and docs-backed notes
- GitBook-backed public release notes at `docs/releases/v1.3.md`
- Railway production-promotion workflow and runbook for the public site, app host, and API
- post-deploy production verification for `mutx.dev`, `app.mutx.dev`, `api.mutx.dev`, and the synced docs release page

### Changed
- `app.mutx.dev/dashboard` is now positioned as the supported browser operator shell for stable routes
- `app.mutx.dev/control/*` stays public but explicitly preview and out of primary stable navigation
- the landing site, release page, GitHub release, and first-party macOS download lane now tell the same `v1.3.0` distribution story
- GitHub app releases now use the versioned docs-backed release note file instead of dumping the full root changelog into the release body
- release notes from `mutx.dev/download/macos/release-notes` now resolve to the synced docs release page instead of only the GitHub release
- release-facing smoke fixtures and desktop status payloads now read the real repo version instead of stale hardcoded values
- release-facing docs, changelog guidance, and install surfaces now describe the desktop + dashboard soft launch coherently

### Fixed
- stale repository support links in GitHub issue templates
- stale release examples in CLI and release docs
- version drift in desktop smoke mocks, bridge system info, and Homebrew formula tests

## [1.2.4] - 2026-03-25

### Fixed
- Committed formatter drift in `cli/commands/update.py` that was still failing the GitHub validation suite

## [1.2.3] - 2026-03-25

### Fixed
- Release validation no longer trips on committed CLI lint/format drift
- Generated OpenAPI and frontend API type artifacts are now in sync with the committed API surface, unblocking the release gate

## [1.2.2] - 2026-03-25

### Fixed
- CLI release validation now uses the same Node 24 and `npm ci --legacy-peer-deps` install lane as main CI, so `cli-v*` tags can complete the release pipeline

## [1.2.1] - 2026-03-25

### Changed
- `mutx update` now supports the installer-managed Homebrew and source-overlay install lane instead of only git checkouts
- CLI release tags now publish the Homebrew tap automatically by regenerating and pushing `mutx-dev/homebrew-tap`

### Fixed
- `mutx tui` no longer crashes when upstream session data contains duplicate session ids with different keys
- Homebrew packaging now tracks tagged CLI release archives instead of a drifting raw commit snapshot

## [1.2.0] - 2026-03-25

### Added
- **Faramesh Governance Engine** - Core auto-installed governance component for agent decision-making
- **Credential Broker** - Multi-backend secret management (Vault, AWS Secrets, GCP Secret Manager, Azure Key Vault, 1Password, Infisical)

- **Faramesh Supervision** - Production agent supervision via `faramesh run` with auto-restart and health checks
- **SPIFFE/SPIRE Identity** - Workload identity provider for secure agent authentication
- **Observability Dashboard** - Agent run tracking with MutxRun/MutxStep schema (agent-run standard)
- **AARM Security Layer** - Security evaluation, approvals, receipts, and sessions
- **Textual-based `mutx tui`** operator shell for agents and deployments
- **Shared CLI service layer** under `cli/services/*` for auth, agents, and deployments
- **Homebrew tap** scaffold with `Formula/mutx.rb` and non-network `mutx status` formula test guidance
- **`mutx update`** command to update MUTX from git without reinstallation
- **`mutx governance`** CLI with subcommands: status, decisions, pending, metrics, tail, start, approve, deny, kill, policy, credential, webhook, supervise
- **Dashboard navigation** for observability, analytics, sessions, and API keys

### Changed
- Root CLI distribution versioning now tracks the root `pyproject.toml` and `cli-vX.Y.Z` tags
- CLI docs, quickstart, and debugging notes now reflect the `/v1/*` API contract and the TUI install flow
- TUI now loads governance and observability data on mount

## [1.1.0] - 2026-03-22

### Added
- MUTX-owned installer and setup wizard that keeps the first-run flow inside the MUTX shell instead of bouncing users through raw subprocess prompts
- OpenClaw provider runtime support across the installer, CLI, TUI, API snapshot sync, and dashboard setup surfaces
- Local runtime registry under `~/.mutx/providers/openclaw` for tracked manifests, bindings, wizard state, and pointer files to upstream OpenClaw assets
- Assistant-first runtime commands such as `mutx runtime list`, `mutx runtime inspect openclaw`, and `mutx runtime open openclaw --surface tui|configure`
- Managed localhost control-plane bootstrap under `~/.mutx/runtime/local-control` for the Docker-backed local lane
- Provider-aware onboarding and runtime snapshot APIs for surfacing honest last-seen local state in hosted control-plane views
- Demo validation coverage for the real Docker-backed stack boot path

### Changed
- Quickstart now centers a single primary install command: `curl -fsSL https://mutx.dev/install.sh | bash`
- Hosted and local setup both run through the same assistant-first bootstrap path, with OpenClaw install, import, onboarding, tracking, binding, deploy, and verification steps
- The TUI now prefers the control-plane workflow after setup and uses a smaller MUTX banner plus calmer first-run surfaces
- Landing page, quickstart copy, and dashboard setup screens now explain the OpenClaw flow as a MUTX-managed provider experience instead of a loose external prerequisite
- CLI release and packaging expectations now align around the root Python distribution, `cli-vX.Y.Z` tags, and a third-party Homebrew tap

### Fixed
- Local Docker demo boot no longer collides with stale fixed container names; the stack now uses project-scoped compose names
- Demo validation now applies Alembic migrations before API readiness checks and waits on `/ready` instead of a weaker health probe
- API migration boot now uses the correct sync PostgreSQL driver path for `psycopg`
- The `user_settings` migration now matches the real UUID user schema instead of creating an invalid foreign-key type mismatch in PostgreSQL
- Local development JWT defaults now satisfy runtime validation so the demo stack can boot without manual secret patching
- Installer, local bootstrap, and OpenClaw tracking flows now produce cleaner recovery behavior when existing local state is present

### Notes
- Current repository footprint: 1,352 commits, 741 tracked files, 25 FastAPI route modules, 86 CLI/TUI files, and 246 test files in this checkout.
- `v1.1` is meant to describe the real shipped operator surface in the repo today, not just the short delta from the previous `v1` release note.
