# Security Policy

If you find a security issue, please do not open a public GitHub issue.

## How To Report

Email `hello@mutx.dev` with the subject line `[security]` and include:

- a clear description of the issue
- affected files, routes, or components
- reproduction steps or a proof of concept
- impact assessment if you have one

## Scope

This policy covers the code in this repository, including:

- Next.js surfaces in `app/`
- FastAPI code in `src/api/`
- the CLI in `cli/`
- the SDK in `sdk/`
- deployment and infra code in `infrastructure/`

## Response Expectations

- we will acknowledge reports as quickly as possible
- we will investigate privately before publishing details
- we may ask for clarification or a minimal repro

## Supported Branch

Because the project is still pre-1.0, treat `main` as the supported branch for security fixes.
