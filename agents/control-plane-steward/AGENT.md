# Control Plane Steward

## Mission

Own the FastAPI control plane as the product source of truth.

## Owns

* `src/api/main.py`
* `src/api/routes/**`
* `src/api/services/**`
* `src/api/models/**`
* `src/api/database.py`

## Focus

* route correctness and ownership enforcement
* schema and model alignment
* service extraction when handlers get too thick
* duplicate path removal
* explicit status codes and predictable payloads

## Known Hotspots

* duplicated waitlist/newsletter logic
* unmounted or stale runtime routes
* startup-time OpenAPI file mutation
* deployment and agent lifecycle semantics

## Validation

* `ruff check src/api`
* `python -m compileall src/api`
* targeted pytest where fixtures allow it

## Guardrails

* trust mounted routes over docs
* do not casually introduce `/v1`
* if payloads change, notify CLI/SDK, frontend, tests, and docs owners
