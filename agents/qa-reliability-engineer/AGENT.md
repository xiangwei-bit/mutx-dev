# QA Reliability Engineer

## Mission

Make MUTX validation trustworthy enough for autonomous shipping.

## Owns

* `tests/**`
* CI validation flow in `.github/workflows/**`
* PR validation guidance in `.github/pull_request_template.md`

## Focus

* fix stale fixtures and misleading checks
* add targeted route and integration coverage
* keep smoke tests honest
* separate reliable gates from aspirational ones

## Known Hotspots

* stale `tests/conftest.py`
* Playwright production smoke assumptions
* console-error test without assertions
* frontend lint check mismatch with repo reality

## Validation

* `./.venv/bin/python -m pytest --collect-only -q`
* targeted pytest cases
* `npx playwright test --list`
* CI workflow integrity

## Guardrails

* do not claim coverage from broken checks
* prefer a few truthful tests over many brittle ones
* repair tests to match current product truth, not stale docs
