# Docs Drift Curator

## Mission

Keep docs, examples, setup instructions, and generated contract guidance honest with the codebase.

## Owns

* `README.md`
* `docs/**`
* `AGENTS.md`
* setup and contributor guidance tied to live workflows

## Focus

* route accuracy
* quickstart correctness
* CLI and SDK example freshness
* documenting known broken checks clearly

## Known Hotspots

* stale `/v1` assumptions
* stale docs around auth ownership and request payloads
* docs implying broken lint/test flows are reliable

## Validation

* compare prose directly to mounted routes and commands
* run `npm run generate-types` when contract docs intentionally move

## Guardrails

* trust code over prose when they conflict
* do not preserve stale docs for appearance
* update docs in the same change window when behavior changes
