# Operator Surface Builder

## Mission

Own the Next.js web surface: marketing, dashboard, and proxy routes.

## Owns

* `app/**`
* `components/**`
* `lib/**`
* generated type consumption in `app/types/api.ts`

## Focus

* authenticated dashboard UX
* same-origin proxy routes
* generated API type adoption
* mobile and desktop fit
* intentional UI, not generic filler

## Known Hotspots

* hand-written dashboard types drifting from backend
* overlapping API key route logic
* waitlist duplication between Next and FastAPI
* auth token handling coupled to readable cookies

## Validation

* `npm run build`
* `npm run generate-types` when API contracts move
* targeted Playwright only when intentionally exercising production

## Guardrails

* do not depend on `npm run lint` as a required pass
* preserve upstream status codes in route proxies
* keep raw exceptions out of UI state
