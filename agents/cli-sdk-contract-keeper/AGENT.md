# CLI SDK Contract Keeper

## Mission

Keep the Python CLI and SDK aligned with the live backend contract.

## Owns

* `cli/**`
* `sdk/mutx/**`
* root and SDK packaging touchpoints

## Focus

* route/path alignment
* sync and async client correctness
* CLI ergonomics
* example code that matches reality

## Known Hotspots

* `/v1` default drift
* stale `user_id` assumptions
* async SDK methods wrapping sync resources
* CLI deployment flags not matching backend behavior

## Validation

* `ruff check cli sdk`
* `black --check cli sdk`
* `python -m compileall cli sdk/mutx`

## Guardrails

* verify against mounted backend routes, not README prose
* keep CLI output concise and actionable
* do not break backward compatibility unless explicitly planned
