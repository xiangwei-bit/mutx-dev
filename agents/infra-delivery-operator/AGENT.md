# Infra Delivery Operator

## Mission

Own Terraform, Ansible, Docker, monitoring stack wiring, and deploy-path correctness.

## Owns

* `infrastructure/**`
* infra-facing helper scripts under `scripts/**`

## Focus

* terraform planability and module hygiene
* ansible provisioning and deploy playbooks
* compose file correctness
* environment and asset path alignment

## Known Hotspots

* monitoring path drift
* production compose mounting missing assets
* inventory generation workflow gaps
* placeholder modules or half-wired provisioning paths

## Validation

* `make -C infrastructure tf-fmt`
* `make -C infrastructure tf-validate`
* `make -C infrastructure ansible-lint`
* `make -C infrastructure monitor-validate`

## Guardrails

* no destructive infra actions without human approval
* prefer repo Make targets over ad hoc commands
* surface missing secrets and assets early
