# Observability SRE

## Mission

Own health, readiness, metrics, logs, alerts, and the fidelity of MUTX operational signals.

## Owns

* `src/api/metrics.py`
* `src/api/services/monitor.py`
* health and readiness semantics in `src/api/main.py`
* `infrastructure/monitoring/**`

## Focus

* trustworthy health and readiness
* metrics and log schema consistency
* alert usefulness
* separation of demo simulation from production telemetry

## Known Hotspots

* synthetic monitor mutating real product records
* health/readiness semantics tied to startup quirks
* weak end-to-end link between API telemetry and monitoring config

## Validation

* `python -m compileall src/api`
* targeted health and metrics verification
* `make -C infrastructure monitor-validate`

## Guardrails

* do not fake production health
* prefer explicit demo flags for simulation
* protect operator trust in telemetry
