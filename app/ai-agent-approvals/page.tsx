      "A human-in-the-loop gate that blocks selected agent actions until an authorized operator approves, rejects, or escalates — with full execution context visible.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do approvals actually block the agent?",
    answer:
      "Yes — that&rsquo;s the entire point. MUTX approvals are control plane gates, not advisory notifications. High-risk actions wait for a decision instead of racing ahead.",

    question: "Which actions usually need human approval?",

  {
    question: "Can operators tell which actions were autonomous and which were approved?",

      "Yes. Approval state is visible alongside traces, audit logs, and governance records — so you can distinguish autonomous behavior from human-authorized behavior during any investigation.",
