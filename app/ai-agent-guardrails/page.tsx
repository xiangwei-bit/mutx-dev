                  Most guardrail setups check a compliance box without blocking
                  anything real. MUTX guardrails are enforced by the control
                  plane at runtime — not by prompt instructions a capable model
                  will sidestep when the stakes are high.

                <p className={feat.sectionBody}>
                  Auth boundaries and compliance requirements become guardrail
                  policies in MUTX. When a violation fires, it surfaces in
                  monitoring, gets recorded in the audit log, and can trip a
                  circuit breaker — all coordinated by the control plane.

                    Guardrails turn governance policies into runtime
                    enforcement. The abstract auth boundary in your governance
                    model becomes the concrete guardrail that fires in
                    production.

                    Guardrail violations are first-class monitoring events. The

                    surrounding context — not just an error code.

                    Guardrail violations can trip circuit breakers. A repeated
                    policy violation isn&rsquo;t just a compliance issue —
                    it&rsquo;s a reliability signal the control plane can act on.
