## Biggest instruction fix

The old custom instruction block had a real contradiction:

- it said not to request personal data by default
- then forced USER telemetry with “user name & email”

That is now fixed. The updated instruction set makes telemetry conditional, tool-aware, redacted, and optional when no compatible embed tool exists.
