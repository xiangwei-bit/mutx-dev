# App and Dashboard

This page documents the current truth of `app.mutx.dev`.

## Current role

`app.mutx.dev` is the operator-facing app host.

Right now it has two distinct browser roles:

- `/dashboard` is the supported authenticated operator shell for stable routes backed by live `/v1/*` API calls
- `/control/*` is the browser demo shell for the control-plane story

## What exists today

### Auth flows

The app exposes browser-facing auth route handlers under `app/api/auth/`:

- `POST /api/auth/register`
- `POST /api/auth/login`
- `POST /api/auth/logout`
- `GET /api/auth/me`

Those handlers proxy to the FastAPI control plane and manage browser cookies for the web surface.

### Dashboard and resource proxies

The app exposes current resource routes such as:

- `GET /api/dashboard/agents`
- `GET /api/dashboard/agents/{agentId}`
- `GET /api/dashboard/deployments`
- `GET /api/dashboard/deployments/{id}`
- `GET /api/dashboard/runs`
- `GET /api/dashboard/runs/{runId}`
- `GET /api/dashboard/runs/{runId}/traces`
- `GET /api/dashboard/sessions`
- `GET /api/dashboard/swarms`
- `GET /api/dashboard/budgets`
- `GET /api/dashboard/monitoring/alerts`
- `GET /api/dashboard/assistant/overview`
- `GET /api/dashboard/health`
- `GET /api/api-keys`
- `POST /api/api-keys`
- `DELETE /api/api-keys/{id}`
- `POST /api/api-keys/{id}/rotate`
- `GET /api/webhooks`
- `POST /api/webhooks`
- `GET /api/agents`
- `POST /api/agents`
- `GET /api/deployments`
- `POST /api/deployments`

### Rendered shells

The current dashboard shell is split between stable operator pages and preview/demo or redirect-backed pages.

Stable pages:

- overview
- auth
- agents
- deployments
- runs and traces
- sessions and swarms
- budgets and monitoring
- skills and bundles
- API keys
- webhooks

Preview/demo or redirect-backed pages:

- channels
- orchestration
- memory
- spawn
- logs

Release hardening now adds:

- a composed `GET /api/dashboard/overview` route for the first-view dashboard contract
- fail-closed release validation for lint, typecheck, build, serial browser smoke, desktop cockpit smoke, and signed macOS artifact validation
- first-party desktop download routes at `mutx.dev/download/macos/*` that resolve to the current signed GitHub release assets
- explicit desktop lifecycle diagnostics for the UI server, bridge, runtime, control plane, and assistant binding
- primary-nav gating for preview or redirect-backed routes such as channels, skills, orchestration, memory, spawn, and logs

The control demo is rendered from `app/control/[[...slug]]/page.tsx`.

## Important boundary

The app surface is not the canonical source for route contracts.

When describing behavior:

- trust `src/api/routes/` for backend semantics
- trust `app/api/` for browser proxy behavior
- trust the app shell for UX positioning only

## Domain split summary

| Surface | Main job |
| --- | --- |
| `mutx.dev` | public product narrative and entry point |
| `mutx.dev/releases` | public release summary and download posture |
| `docs.mutx.dev` | canonical docs and API explanation |
| `app.mutx.dev/dashboard` | supported operator-facing authenticated shell for stable routes |
| `app.mutx.dev/control/*` | demo surface for the browser control-plane story |

## Known gaps

- no full write-complete dashboard for all resources
- dashboard maturity still trails the backend resource model
- some flows remain easier through the CLI or direct API
- some backend capabilities remain placeholder-backed, especially scheduler and full RAG search
- preview-labeled or redirect-backed routes must stay out of the primary stable navigation until their live contracts are complete
- the control demo and preview-backed routes should stay explicitly preview even while the stable dashboard lane is supported

That gap should be documented plainly so the product surface stays trustworthy.
