# Autonomous Shipping Operating Model

This is the lightweight GitHub-native harness for autonomous 24/7 development.

## Goal

Ship a high volume of small, reviewed, testable changes every day without giving unattended agents direct production power.

## Principles

- optimize for trustworthy throughput, not chaotic output
- keep changes small and file ownership clear
- require review by a different agent than the author
- stage before production for anything that changes contracts, auth, runtime, or infrastructure
- enforce patch and changed-file guardrails so one autonomous pass stays small

## Lanes

### Lane A: Safe Auto-Merge
- docs
- test repairs
- small CLI and SDK parity fixes
- small frontend proxy or type alignment

Requirements:
- one reviewer agent
- required CI green
- labels `autonomy:safe` and `size:xs` or `size:s`

### Lane B: Staging-First Product Work
- backend route changes
- dashboard features
- observability improvements

Requirements:
- one reviewer agent
- required CI green
- staging deploy success

### Lane C: Human-Gated Risk
- auth/session changes
- runtime protocol changes
- infrastructure changes
- database migrations

Requirements:
- human approval
- targeted verification evidence

## Control Loop

1. Scheduled workflow runs every 15 minutes.
2. Orchestrator scans open issues labeled `autonomy:ready`.
3. Work is assigned to a single owning agent based on area labels.
4. Authoring agent creates a branch and PR.
5. Reviewer agent checks scope, ownership, validation, and drift. If reviewer login mapping is configured, PR assignment follows the work order.
6. CI gates run.
7. Safe PRs auto-merge; risky PRs stop for human approval.
8. Stale claimed issues with no open PR are automatically released back into the queue after the configured timeout.

## Required Labels

- area labels: `area:api`, `area:web`, `area:auth`, `area:cli-sdk`, `area:runtime`, `area:test`, `area:infra`, `area:ops`, `area:docs`
- risk labels: `risk:low`, `risk:medium`, `risk:high`
- autonomy labels: `autonomy:ready`, `autonomy:safe`, `autonomy:blocked`, `autonomy:claimed`
- size labels: `size:xs`, `size:s`, `size:m`, `size:l`

## Recommended Protections

- branch protection on `main`
- require PRs for all changes
- require at least one approval
- require CI
- enable auto-merge only after labels and checks pass
- block force-pushes to protected branches

## Validation Truth Contract

Keep CI aligned with what the repo actually supports today.

- `scripts/test.sh` is the authoritative repo-wide validation entrypoint for CI.
- Python API truth comes from `pytest tests/api`, lint/format checks, and compile checks.
- Frontend truth comes from generated API types, lint, build, and the checked-in Playwright smoke suite.
- Playwright is currently a production-smoke lane, not a generic localhost integration lane. If the suite assumes hosted behavior (for example Turnstile bootstrapping), CI should provide the matching test shim instead of failing on expected external-service gaps.
- Infra validation should live in dedicated workflows/targets (`make tf-validate`, `make monitor-validate`, drift workflows) rather than silently piggybacking on unrelated app PRs.
- When a validation lane starts failing for config drift rather than product breakage, either fix the fixture/assumption immediately or remove that lane from required CI until it is truthful again.

## What Not To Automate Yet

- direct production infra changes
- auth-breaking changes
- broad schema migrations
- destructive data operations
- unreviewed runtime protocol changes

## First Four Agents To Activate

1. `mission-control-orchestrator`
2. `qa-reliability-engineer`
3. `cli-sdk-contract-keeper`
4. `control-plane-steward`

These four reduce drift and improve validation enough to safely expand the team.
