# Licensing

## License Structure

MUTX uses a split licensing model:

| Component | License | Change Date |
| --------- | ------- | ----------- |
| MUTX core (all code except `sdk/`) | BUSL-1.1 | 36 months after each version's release |
| Python SDK (`sdk/mutx/`) | Apache-2.0 | Never (perpetual) |

## MUTX Core — BUSL-1.1

MUTX core is **source-available** under the Business Source License (BUSL-1.1).

This means you can inspect, read, and run the source code. You may also modify it for internal use. However, you may not offer MUTX or a substantially similar product to third parties as a hosted, managed, white-labeled, OEM, or embedded service.

Each BUSL release converts to Apache-2.0 36 months after that version was first publicly released.

**Key points:**
- Internal use is allowed
- Plugins, integrations, and client libraries that do not embed the Licensed Work are permitted
- Competing commercial offerings (hosted, managed, white-labeled, OEM, embedded) require a commercial license
- The MUTX name and logo are trademarks — see Trademark Policy below

For the full license text, see the [LICENSE](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mutx-dev/mutx-dev/main/LICENSE) file at the repository root.

## Python SDK — Apache-2.0

The MUTX Python SDK (`sdk/mutx/`) is licensed under Apache-2.0. This license permits broad use including commercial applications, subject to the standard Apache-2.0 terms.

See [sdk/LICENSE](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mutx-dev/mutx-dev/main/sdk/LICENSE) for the full license text.

## Third-Party Code

MUTX incorporates MIT-licensed components:

- **agent-run** (builderz-labs) — Observability schema
- **AARM** (aarm-dev) — Security layer specification
- **Faramesh** (Faramesh Technologies) — Governance engine
- **Mission Control** (builderz-labs) — Dashboard inspiration and tracked direct dashboard-pattern reuse
- **Orchestra Research AI-Research-SKILLs** — Imported skill catalog metadata, curated bundles, and runtime sync path for research/operator workflows
- **predict-rlm** (Trampoline AI) — Document workflow engine integration plus adapted template contracts and operator docs aligned to the upstream document analysis, contract comparison, invoice processing, and document redaction examples

All third-party code remains under its original license. See [CREDITS.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mutx-dev/mutx-dev/main/CREDITS.md) for full attribution and license texts.

Direct feature ports and materially adapted upstream workflow surfaces from Mission Control (MIT), LACP (MIT), Guild AI (Apache-2.0), and predict-rlm (MIT) are tracked in the [OSS Attribution Ledger](oss-attribution-ledger.md). The ledger records the upstream source, local MUTX scope, and whether the reuse was direct or still pending.

MUTX and the MUTX logo are registered trademarks. The code license does not grant trademark rights. See [TRADEMARKS.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mutx-dev/mutx-dev/main/TRADEMARKS.md) for the full policy.
