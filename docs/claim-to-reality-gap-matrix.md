## 3. Automation / Redundancy Findings

### 3.1 Autonomy Scripts Inventory

All scripts are located in `scripts/autonomy/` unless otherwise noted.

| Script | Purpose | Classification | Redundancy |
|--------|---------|----------------|-------------|
| `autonomous-coder.py` | Reads action queue, calls MiniMax-M2.7 via local gateway, generates code changes, commits and opens PRs | SHIPPED (active) | Overlaps with `autonomous-loop.py` and `autonomous-loop-v3.sh` |
| `autonomous-loop.py` | Supervisor using `sessions_spawn` via subprocess WS connection to OpenClaw gateway | LEGACY | Replaced by `autonomous-loop-v3.sh` and `mutx-autonomous-daemon.py` |
| `autonomous-loop.sh` | Bash loop that calls Codex for implementation | LEGACY/STUB | Replaced by `autonomous-loop-v3.sh` |
| `autonomous-loop-v3.sh` | Bash loop that calls `openclaw sessions spawn` for implementation | SHIPPED | Evolved from `autonomous-loop.sh` |
| `mutx-autonomous-daemon.py` | Self-supervising Python daemon with heartbeat, worktree sync, and area-specific implementation stubs | SHIPPED (most mature) | Consolidates watchdog and heartbeat logic |
| `mutx-master-controller.py` | Runs gap scanner + daemon watchdog in one supervised double-forked process | SHIPPED | Parent supervisor for gap scan + daemon health |
| `mutx-gap-scanner-v3.py` | Scans GitHub issues, stale PRs, SDK coverage gaps; adds to queue | SHIPPED (active version) | Replaces `mutx-gap-scanner.py` |
| `mutx-gap-scanner.py` | Code-analysis-based gap scanner (TODOs, error handling, deps, API docs) | LEGACY | Replaced by `mutx-gap-scanner-v3.py` |
| `build_work_order.py` | Scores GitHub issues by labels, picks top work order, routes to agent/lane | SHIPPED | Queue infrastructure |
| `execute_work_order.py` | Prepares git branch, writes brief, optionally runs agent command and opens PR | SHIPPED | Queue executor |
| `select_agent.py` | Maps issue labels to agent names and lane strategy | SHIPPED | Shared utility |
| `hosted_llm_executor.py` | Calls hosted LLM (GitHub Models or OpenAI) with work order prompt, applies patch | SHIPPED | Agent execution via hosted models |
| `github_hosted_agent.py` | Builds prompt bundle for a GitHub-hosted coding agent | SHIPPED | Prompt builder wrapper |
| `queue-feeder.sh` | Cron script: adds `autonomy:ready` GitHub issues to action queue | SHIPPED | Queue maintenance |
| `mutx-heartbeat.sh` | Runs `make dev`, reports health, opens GitHub issue if broken | SHIPPED | Repo health monitor |
| `mutx-daemon-watchdog.sh` | Checks if daemon is alive, restarts if dead, resets stuck queue items | SHIPPED | Daemon health watchdog |
| `daemon-launcher.py` | Launchd wrapper — prevents fork when launched by launchd | SHIPPED (in ~/MUTX only) | Only exists in ~/MUTX, NOT in mutx-dev clone |

### 3.2 Redundancy Map

**3 parallel autonomous coding loops:**
1. `autonomous-coder.py` — MiniMax via gateway, Python
2. `autonomous-loop-v3.sh` — OpenClaw `sessions spawn`, Bash
3. `mutx-autonomous-daemon.py` — Self-supervising Python daemon with implementation stubs

All three read from the same queue (`/Users/fortune/MUTX/mutx-engineering-agents/dispatch/action-queue.json`).

**2 parallel gap scanners:**
1. `mutx-gap-scanner-v3.py` — GitHub API + coverage gap focused
2. `mutx-gap-scanner.py` — Code analysis focused (TODOs, error handling)

### 3.3 Hardcoded Path Dependencies (Portable Audit Blockers)

These scripts have hardcoded absolute paths that will break if the repo moves:

| Script | Hardcoded Paths |
|--------|-----------------|
| `autonomous-coder.py` | `REPO = "/Users/fortune/MUTX"`, `WT_BACKEND`, `WT_FRONTEND`, `QUEUE`, `LOG`, `GW = "http://localhost:18789"` |
| `autonomous-loop.py` | `QUEUE = "/Users/fortune/MUTX/..."`, `LOG`, `WT_BACKEND`, `sock_path = "/var/run/openclaw/gateway.sock"` |
| `autonomous-loop.sh` | `QUEUE_FILE="/Users/fortune/MUTX/..."`, `REPO="/Users/fortune/MUTX"`, worktree paths |
| `autonomous-loop-v3.sh` | Same hardcoded paths |
| `mutx-autonomous-daemon.py` | `REPO`, `QUEUE`, `LOG`, `PID_FILE`, `WT_BACK`, `WT_FRONT`, `GH_REPO="mutx-dev/mutx-dev"` |
| `mutx-master-controller.py` | `REPO="/Users/fortune/MUTX"`, `DAEMON`, `GAPSCAN`, `QUEUE`, `LOG`, `PIDFILE` |
| `mutx-gap-scanner-v3.py` | `GH="/opt/homebrew/bin/gh"`, `QUEUE`, `LOG`, `REPO`, `WT`, `GH_REPO` |
| `mutx-gap-scanner.py` | `REPO="/Users/fortune/MUTX"` |
| `hosted_llm_executor.py` | Hardcodes `agents/{agent}/AGENT.md` paths, area context files |
| `queue-feeder.sh` | `QUEUE_FILE="/Users/fortune/MUTX/..."`, `cd /Users/fortune/MUTX` |
| `mutx-heartbeat.sh` | `REPO="/Users/fortune/MUTX"`, `LOG`, `GITHUB_REPO` |
| `mutx-daemon-watchdog.sh` | `LOG`, `QUEUE`, `DAEMON`, `cd /Users/fortune/MUTX` |

### 3.4 Missing External Dependencies

| Path | Status |
|------|--------|
| `/Users/fortune/mutx-worktrees/factory/backend` | Does not exist — referenced by all loop scripts |
| `/Users/fortune/mutx-worktrees/factory/frontend` | Does not exist — referenced by all loop scripts |
| `/Users/fortune/MUTX/mutx-engineering-agents/dispatch/action-queue.json` | Queue file location — external to both clones |
| `/var/run/openclaw/gateway.sock` | OpenClaw Unix socket — gateway may not be running |
| `agents/{agent}/AGENT.md` | Agent definitions referenced by `hosted_llm_executor.py` — may not exist |

### 4.2 Summary Statistics

| Classification | Count | Previous |
|---------------|-------|----------|
| SHIPPED | 29 | 30 |
| PARTIAL | 2 | 2 |
| STUB | 1 | 1 |
| PLACEHOLDER | 0 | 0 |
| MISLEADING | 0 | 0 |

---

## 5. Key Gaps Remaining

1. **Vault integration remains a STUB** — the only infrastructure component still explicitly documented as incomplete.

2. **Newsletter route unmounted** — `/v1/newsletter` code exists but router is explicitly excluded from serving. Should either be removed or docs updated to not claim it.

3. **Auth header `required: false` in OpenAPI** — Despite auth enforcement across 29/32 route modules, the OpenAPI spec still marks authorization header as `required: false` on 157 endpoint-method pairs. This is a spec accuracy issue, not a runtime enforcement gap — the code enforces auth via FastAPI dependencies.

4. **Hardcoded paths block portability** — Every autonomy script hardcodes `/Users/fortune/MUTX` and references non-existent worktree directories.

5. **3 parallel autonomous loop implementations** — Consolidation opportunity remains unchanged.

6. **`daemon-launcher.py` drift** — Still exists only in `~/MUTX`, absent from `mutx-dev`.
