# Railway Deployment

Deploy to Railway for managed hosting.

## Railway Setup

### 1. Install Railway CLI

```bash
# macOS
brew install railway

# Or using npm
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login
railway login

# Verify
railway whoami
```

### 2. Initialize Project

```bash
# Create new project
railway init

# Or link existing
railway link
```

### 3. Add Database

```bash
# Add PostgreSQL
railway add postgresql

# Add Redis
railway add redis
```

## Environment Variables

### Required Variables

Set these in Railway dashboard (Settings → Variables):

```bash
# Database (auto-populated by Railway)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...  # Auto-configured

# Only set this if your Railway PostgreSQL endpoint rejects SSL upgrade attempts
# DATABASE_SSL_MODE=disable

# JWT
JWT_SECRET=your-secure-jwt-secret-min-32-chars

# Optional startup behavior
DATABASE_REQUIRED_ON_STARTUP=false

# Site URLs
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://your-app.railway.app

# Frontend -> API routing
# For a single Railway service, NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL can stay public.
# For split frontend/backend Railway services, prefer the backend private domain here.
INTERNAL_API_URL=http://your-backend.railway.internal:8080

# Optional public API URL if you intentionally expose the backend directly.
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.yourdomain.com

# Email (optional)
RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_resend_api_key
```

### Railway JSON Config

The API service uses a Dockerfile-based deployment and a liveness health check:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://railway.app/railway.schema.json",
  "build": {
    "builder": "DOCKERFILE",
    "dockerfilePath": "infrastructure/docker/Dockerfile.backend"
  },
  "deploy": {
    "numReplicas": 1,
    "restartPolicyType": "ON_FAILURE",
    "restartPolicyMaxRetries": 10,
    "healthcheckPath": "/health",
    "healthcheckTimeout": 60
  }
}
```

`/health` is a liveness endpoint and returns `200` even while the app is still retrying database startup. Use `/ready` to confirm the database is connected before sending traffic that depends on PostgreSQL.

## Database Setup

### 1. Create Database

In Railway dashboard:

1. Go to your project
2. Click "New" → "Database" → "PostgreSQL"
3. Note the connection string

### 2. Initialize the Schema

```bash
# The API currently bootstraps its tables on startup.
# You can still run ad hoc database commands with Railway CLI if needed.
```

### 3. Seed Data (Optional)

```bash
railway run python -m src.api.seed
```

## Deploy

### 1. Deploy to Railway

```bash
# Deploy the linked service
railway up

# Or with environment
railway up --environment production
```

### 2. View Deployment

```bash
# Open in browser
railway open

# View logs
railway logs

# Follow logs
railway logs -f
```

### 3. Verify Deployment

```bash
# Get deployment URL
railway url

# Test health endpoint
curl https://your-app.railway.app/health
```

## Custom Domain

### 1. Add Domain

In Railway dashboard:

1. Go to project → Settings → Domains
2. Add custom domain (e.g., mutx.dev)
3. Note the CNAME record

### 2. Configure DNS

Add CNAME record:

```
Type: CNAME
Name: mutx.dev
Value: your-app.railway.app
```

### 3. SSL

Railway automatically provisions Let's Encrypt SSL.

## Multiple Services

For a more complete setup, create multiple Railway services:

### Service 1: Frontend (Next.js)

```json
{
  "name": "frontend",
  "build": {
    "builder": "NIXPACKS"
  },
  "deploy": {
    "numReplicas": 2,
    "startCommand": "npm run start"
  }
}
```

### Service 2: API (FastAPI)

Use the checked-in backend Dockerfile:

```text
infrastructure/docker/Dockerfile.backend
```

Railway service configs in this repo already point at the canonical backend and frontend Dockerfiles under `infrastructure/docker/`.

## Production Promotion

MUTX v1.3 treats Railway as the production host for:

- `mutx.dev`
- `app.mutx.dev`
- `api.mutx.dev`

The repo now includes a production-promotion lane for Railway so web/app rollout does not depend on a local operator shell.

### GitHub Actions secrets

Set these repository secrets before using the Railway promotion workflow:

- `RAILWAY_TOKEN`
- `RAILWAY_PROJECT_ID`
- `RAILWAY_FRONTEND_SERVICE_ID`
- `RAILWAY_API_SERVICE_ID`
- `RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT_ID`

Optional repository variables or workflow inputs:

- `MUTX_SITE_URL`
- `MUTX_APP_URL`
- `MUTX_API_URL`
- `MUTX_DOCS_RELEASE_URL`

### Promotion flow

```bash
bash scripts/promote-railway-production.sh
bash scripts/verify-production-release.sh
```

### Live production note

Live production project: `zooming-youth`.

Live Railway production currently runs the backend without an explicit healthcheckPath/healthcheckTimeout in the deployed service manifest, even though repo-side examples may show those fields. Do not change backend Railway healthcheck behavior casually from repo config alone.

Live Railway production currently serves these custom domains:

- frontend custom domains: `mutx.dev`, `app.mutx.dev`
- backend custom domain: `api.mutx.dev`

Live Railway production also uses this backend preDeployCommand:

```bash
python -m pip install -q psycopg2-binary alembic && python -m alembic upgrade head
```

Treat the backend preDeployCommand as production-critical until Railway and repo config are intentionally reconciled. Use live Railway service manifests as the source of truth before changing production deployment behavior.

The verification step should confirm:

- `https://mutx.dev`
- `https://mutx.dev/download/macos`
- `https://app.mutx.dev/login`
- `https://app.mutx.dev/register`
- `https://app.mutx.dev/dashboard`
- `https://api.mutx.dev/health`
- `https://api.mutx.dev/ready`
- `https://docs.mutx.dev/docs/v1.3`

Create `railway.json` for API:

```json
{
  "name": "api",
  "build": {
    "builder": "DOCKERFILE",
    "dockerfilePath": "api/Dockerfile"
  },
  "deploy": {
    "numReplicas": 2,
    "startCommand": "uvicorn src.api.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000"
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Build Failed

```bash
# Check build logs
railway logs --type build
```

### Service Not Starting

```bash
# Check runtime logs
railway logs --type runtime

# Common issues:
# - Missing environment variables
# - Port not exposed
# - Build command incorrect
```

### Database Connection

```bash
# Verify DATABASE_URL
railway variables | grep DATABASE

# Optional: disable SSL if the proxy rejects SSL upgrades
railway variables set DATABASE_SSL_MODE=disable
```

### Custom Domain Not Working

```bash
# Verify DNS propagation
dig yourdomain.com

# Check Railway domain status
railway domain list
```

## Maintenance

### Update Deployment

```bash
# Deploy new version
git push railway main

# Or trigger manually
railway up
```

### Rollback

In Railway dashboard:

1. Go to Deployments
2. Find previous deployment
3. Click "Redeploy"

### Scale

In Railway dashboard:

* Go to Settings → Scaling
* Adjust replicas (max 20 on Pro plan)

## Quick Reference

```bash
# Login
railway login

# Initialize
railway init

# Deploy
railway up

# View logs
railway logs

# Add service
railway add postgresql

# Variables
railway variables

# Custom domain
railway domain add yourdomain.com
```

## Auth And Onboarding Checklist

The hosted onboarding flow now depends on the backend email + OAuth contract, not just password auth.

For the live Railway project `zooming-youth`, set these backend variables on the API service:

```bash
FRONTEND_URL=https://app.mutx.dev
CORS_ORIGINS=https://mutx.dev,https://app.mutx.dev,https://pico.mutx.dev
REQUIRE_EMAIL_VERIFICATION=true
EMAIL_VERIFICATION_TOKEN_EXPIRE_HOURS=72

GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=...
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=...
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=...
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=...
DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=...
DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET=...
```

Set `FRONTEND_URL` to the host that should own email verification and password-reset links. `CORS_ORIGINS` should include every frontend host that can initiate auth or OAuth callbacks.

### OAuth callback URIs

Register the callback URIs on each provider app for every frontend host you plan to serve auth from. Current routes terminate at:

- `https://app.mutx.dev/api/auth/oauth/google/callback`
- `https://app.mutx.dev/api/auth/oauth/github/callback`
- `https://app.mutx.dev/api/auth/oauth/discord/callback`

If Pico moves onto its own authenticated host later, register the equivalent `https://pico.mutx.dev/api/auth/oauth/{provider}/callback` endpoints before switching traffic.

### Database and migrations

The backend Railway service already runs `alembic upgrade head` from [railway.json](../../railway.json) before startup, so the external-auth identity table is deployed alongside the API. Keep that pre-start migration step in place for the `zooming-youth` backend service.
